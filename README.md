# Instacart Basket Analysis - Python Project


## Objectives
Examining sales trends, conducting exploratory analysis, and drawing conclusions to improve segmentation for Instacart, an online grocery retailer. The business is curious about its clients' purchasing patterns so they can develop more precise marketing efforts. As a data analyst, my responsibility is to make a suggestion.
## Purpose and Context
I was first exposed to Python through a project I completed in one of my CareerFoundry classes. This assignment was crucial because it gave me the opportunity to use my analytical abilities to do exploratory research on a sizable dataset.
## Goal
Deliver a final report including tables and visualizations that profile Instacart customers based on their purchase behaviors.
